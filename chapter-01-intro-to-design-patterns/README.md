# Notes

## Design Principles

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.

- Favor composition over inheritence.


## Strategy Design Pattern

> The Stratefy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encaptulates each one, and makes  them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## The Power of Shared Pattern Vocabulary

Design Patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developers.

- Patterns allow you to say more with less.
- Talking at the pattern level allows you to stay "in the design" longer.
